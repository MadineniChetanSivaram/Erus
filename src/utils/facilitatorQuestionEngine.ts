  OPENING: `Good morning, everyone! Welcome to the ERUS Student Presentation Activity. Today, six students will present their assigned topics related to research, technology, and industry applications. The objective of this activity is to develop your technical knowledge, communication skills, presentation skills, critical thinking, and confidence. Each student will get 6 to 8 minutes to present their topic. After every presentation, I will invite the remaining students to ask questions related to the topic. This will help you develop the ability to listen carefully, understand technical concepts, think critically, and communicate effectively. Please follow these instructions: 1. Present your topic clearly and confidently. 2. Explain the important concepts with suitable examples. 3. Connect your topic to real-world or industry applications wherever possible. 4. Listen carefully to other students' presentations. 5. Ask relevant and meaningful questions. 6. Answer questions politely and confidently. Remember, this is a learning activity. Do not hesitate to speak, ask questions, or express your ideas. I will now begin the presentations by calling the students in serial order, from Student Number 1 to Student Number 6. Let us begin with Student Number 1!`,

  TRANSITION: `Thank you for your presentation and for participating in the discussion. We have completed the presentation and question session for this student. Let us now move to the next presentation in our sequence. I request the next student to get ready and begin when called. Please remember that every presentation is an opportunity to improve your communication, technical understanding, and professional confidence.`,

  // Page 5: Closing Remarks (verbatim from official document)
  CLOSING: `Congratulations to all six students! We have now successfully completed today's ERUS Student Presentation Activity. Each of you has had an opportunity to present your ideas, explain technical concepts, listen to others, and participate in discussions. I would like you to remember five important lessons from today's activity. First — Technical Knowledge: Understand the topic beyond memorizing facts. Try to explain the concepts in your own words. Second — Communication Skills: Speak clearly, organize your ideas, and use simple, professional language. Third — Presentation Skills: Introduce your topic, explain the key points logically, provide examples, and conclude effectively. Fourth — Critical Thinking: Listen carefully, ask meaningful questions, and evaluate different ideas. Fifth — Confidence: Do not be afraid of making mistakes. Every presentation and every question will help you improve. In the professional world, success depends not only on what you know but also on how effectively you communicate your knowledge, solve problems, and work with others. The purpose of ERUS is to help you develop these skills and prepare yourselves for future academic, research, and employment opportunities. Before our session ends, I encourage every student to reflect on three questions: 1. What did I learn from today's presentations? 2. What is one skill I need to improve? 3. What will I do differently in my next presentation? Keep practising. Keep asking questions. Keep improving. Thank you for your active participation. This concludes today's ERUS Student Presentation Activity. Have a great day!`,
